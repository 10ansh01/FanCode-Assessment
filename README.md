# Project Setup:

- Clone this repo in your local
- Navigate into the project folder if you are using terminal
  - command to run in your terminal: cd FanCode-Assessment
- Make sure you have npm in your system
- use Node 18(Preffered)
- Run "npm install" to install packages
- run "npm start" to run the project and wait for the development server to start automatically

**Note: While testing this app, you will see a "see more" button/link on left bottom of each movie card. That will open up a modal popup. Please read the important notice mentioned in the Modal**

### Since the designs provided to me were only for mobile, the UI may break in some places on desktop and may not be fully responsive. It is advisable to test it by keeping the browser window size set to a mobile device.

## Requirements Covered:

**Note: Please refer the "FE take home assignment: Movie List" pdf that was shared with me by FanCode's HR. I have just written the heading for requirements mentioned in the pdf**

- All the requirements related to Layout and UI are covered
  - refer the assessment detail pdf to know more about this requirement
- All the requirements related to Default page load state are covered
  - refer the assessment detail pdf to know more about this requirement
- API functionality is covered
  - refer the assessment detail pdf to know more about this requirement
- The genres are getting fetched from the required endpoint
- All the requirements related to Genre Filter are covered
  - refer the assessment detail pdf to know more about this requirement
- Code quality is prim and proper
- No pre-built component libraries have been used.

## Bonus Requirements Covered:

- Use of typescript is covered
- I have implement search bar functionlity also
- Scrolling is smooth without any jitters

## Requirements NOT Covered:

- This is a react web app. I have not used React native here

## Things I want to say:

- I have tried to divide the code in a well-structured manner by creating different folders for different components/functionalities of the project
- I have implmented a custom hook called useInfiniteScroll to implement infinite scrolling functionality.
- Each movie card is getting rendered lazily to optimise performance.

**Note: Looking forward to discuss more on this about how can I further make this more robust**
